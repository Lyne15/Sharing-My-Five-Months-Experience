       Some people describe me as nice, while other people describe me as ambitious and passionate one. They may be familiar with my skills and abilities, or they may have seen me strive for the impossible. They are looking at me patiently, wondering how I can remain calm in such a toxic society. The question is, "Do they know exactly who I am?" Do they understand all the risks I've taken? for the difficulties I've overcome? ... The answer is definitely no.
       <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't understand what my older sister meant until I go through a challenge, but she told me that, ``You've never begun to grow unless you experience challenges." I lived in Rizal with my older sister and the rest of my family are transferring to Calamba, Laguna. Together with my older sister and the rest of my family, I live in my aunt's house in the Rizal province. Until they accused me of having stolen her money and cellphone. There were a lot of people in that house, so I'm not sure why she truly believed that I was the one who had taken her things. She spread gossip without providing any evidence. I am aware of my ignorance and the fact that I cannot harm her in that way. She became mad at me and to all of my family.

       <br>
       <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to work as a garbage collector near my aunt's house. I also started working as a housekeeper for financial reasons. I once gave it a chance in the market, but sadly I was scammed. Because the market I saw was just a police ruse to force you into becoming his girlfriend while he is still married in exchange for him providing all of your needs. I decided to leave in the middle of the night to get away from them. I'm the third oldest of the seven siblings, who are all in our family. My mother has asthma, while my father has epilepsy. My father is a technician, while my mother is a housewife who occasionally sews. We are able to study despite of my family status, thanks to the support of our parents. The challenges that I encountered began when I lost my grandfather on my father's side until he passed away. In the same way that he had done for me when he was still living, I looked for protection. Until I realized I was going in the wrong direction, but the Lord did not leave me. I observed how he worked in my life.

       <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I accepted our poor conditions at the time. I came back to my mother's house and saw the people who were sharing the gospel with them, and I came to accept the fact that one day I would just assist or work in factories. The mother of Sir Louie said, "It's very good news that she mentioned Sir Louie is looking for learners who are willing to study programming." Aunt Aira, Sir Louie's mother, offered to assist my sister, but she refused because she works in a call center. I answered, "Maybe I can," but I don't feel sure about my abilities because I struggle with communication in English. I'm not that good in math, either. Therefore, I'm concerned.
       <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started studying programming during September. After learning the fundamentals of Javascript, I was able to create games and ideas with it within a month. Despite everything, I didn't think I could do it, but also I typically considered stopping because I don't always know what I'm doing. one side of me wants to stop but the other side of me wants to continue what was started. I told my sister, <strong>"When I first started, I wanted to stop because I couldn't find out my coding problems, but the days passed without realizing that I was solving them little by little."</strong> Even so, I said... It feels so amazing, even if it's so difficult, <strong>it's good that I continued, look at it for a few weeks, I didn't think that I was able to overcome it."</strong> Additionally, I didn't think I would be able to have a Portfolio Site in December. <em>Sir Louie helped me a lot since he gave me access to the world of programming.</em> I can gradually see that <strong>I'm changing for the better.</strong>
